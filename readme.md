## Handy stuff and tools for a faster, better workflow | Sublime | Composer | Laravel

After watching some tutorials from Laracasts I added a lot of snippets and packages


## Sublime Packages
- origami
Out of the box, Sublime Text offers a handful of "split modes." However, if you want more control, then the Origami package is right up your alley.


- advancedNewfile
- htmlBeautify
- laravel5Artisan
- PackageResourceViewer
- phpCompanion
- php getters and setters
- download  and put in map

## Composer Packages
- composer global require fabpot/php-cs-fixer

## Shortcuts
Origami
	["ctrl+c+up"] 		splits horizontal up
	["ctrl+c+right"] 	splits vertical to right
	["ctrl+c+down"]		splits horizontal down
	["ctrl+c+left"]		splits vertical to right

	["ctrl+c+d"] remove this splits and merge with other panel
